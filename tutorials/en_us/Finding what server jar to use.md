# Intro

Here we will go through how to pick what server jar to use. A server jar contains all the code for the server, there are server jars for modloaders, like forge or fabric, and some that allow you to use plugins.

## Picking your server jar

The first step to finding the right server jar for you is to know what kind of server you want to run: survival, prisons, minigames,... You name it! Oh and don't forget to pick which Minecraft version you want it to be! We will show you some basic ones, afterwards you can look at (link to the page of server jars) for more in-depth explanations etc. 
- 1.16 - If you are planning on creating a survival server for your friend group or a generally small server, you can use [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) or [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/downloads#Paper-1.16). Fabric is mostly known for modded servers but you can install basic plugin port mods on server side and optimization mods for making chunks load faster, creating lighting better etc. Paper is known for being the most optimized fork, you can really squeeze the last drops of performance out of your machine with many built-in tweaks and settings. Both of these support a huge range of plugins who are developed to help you enhance your audience's experience and costumize your server to make it stand out from all the others.
- 1.13 and above - A good server jar to use is [Purpur](https://github.com/pl3xgaming/Purpur), it optimizes performance a lot and adds a lot of features (FLYING SQUIDS :D) to help you optimize your server even further or to add many fun plugins.
- 1.12 and below - PaperMC is generally the best fork for these versions with long term support and of course many bug-fixes.
- 1.0-1.16 - This version is not recommended to host servers on, we suggest updating to a more frequient one.

## Fabric Server Side Mods (you can delete or move this somewhere)
 I have been using fabric for a while now and it felt like it has better mob spawning, the mods I used for optimizasion was mostly from [Here](https://gist.github.com/comp500/12417ee3685f6204362e933c9bcde603) except I changed phospor with StarLight, added Helium Fabric mod and didnt use random patches.
